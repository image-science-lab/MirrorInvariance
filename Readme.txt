PovRay folder has code and a readme for how to generate images of mirrors using PovRay for all surfaces used in the paper

The images generated from PovRay are in the folder "images"

The "code" folder has a simple matlab routine for processing these images.


To begin with:
1) Run the .m file in code folder and look at results.
2) look at the images in the folder "images"
3) Try to run the file "SequenceRenderer.ini" in PovRay file for various .pov files in the povray/pov folder.
